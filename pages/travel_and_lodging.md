# Travel

Seattle-Tacoma International Airport offers a range of connections to the University of Washington Campus.

The [Link light rail](https://www.soundtransit.org/Schedules/Link-light-rail) is an easy, great way to get to the UW from the airport. It picks you up at the airport, comes about every 5-15 minutes, and drops you off right on the UW campus; just a 15 minute walk from the dorms you will be staying in.

From the arrivals hall at Sea-Tac Airport, follow the signs for Link Light Rail; the station is a short walk from the terminal on the far side of the parking garage. Tickets must be purchased at the station before boarding. The cost is $2.50 and can be paid in cash or with a credit/debit card. Take the train to the last stop (UW). [Here are directions](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/UW+%2F+Husky+Stadium+Link+Station,+Montlake+Boulevard+Northeast,+Seattle,+WA/Lander+Hall,+Northeast+Campus+Parkway,+Seattle,+WA/@47.6528701,-122.3174734,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x549014eca005d559:0x2a5b4b6f98dddc9c!2m2!1d-122.3037817!2d47.6498128!1m5!1m1!1s0x549014f3ba755af3:0x942b03c21f9cc45e!2m2!1d-122.3148976!2d47.655826!3e2) walking from the UW link stop to the Lander Hall where you will check in.

Taxiâ€™s and uber/lyft are also available from the airport. Note that for uber/lyft you will meet the car in the 3rd floor parking lot for pick up.
